# evlua

Designed to be an open source, cross platform lua runtime environment for construction of scalable web applications

#### Goals
1. IO event driven (async) processing
2. lua (4GL) for development
3. Multi threaded, with co-operative multitasking (switch task upon IO event)
4. Usage of co-routines to achieve flowing code, i.e. no need for callbacks or promises

#### Inspired by
Node.js, golang
